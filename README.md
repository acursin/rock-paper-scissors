# rock-paper-scissors
A simple javascript implementation of "rock paper scissors".

This is a console-based rock-paper-scissors game written in JavaScript, made according to specifications from The Odin Project. Making this project helped me practice basic JavaScript and programming skills, such as functions, variable scope, conditionals, and loops.

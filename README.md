# rock-paper-scissors
A simple web implementation of "rock paper scissors".

This is a rock-paper-scissors game written in JavaScript and HTML, made according to specifications from The Odin Project. Making this project helped me practice basic JavaScript and programming skills, such as functions, variable scope, conditionals, and loops. Adding the UI helped me practice basic DOM manipulation, such as adding, removing, and editing nodes.
